# WARNING  
Backup your saves before using this tool, and restore the backups before going online. Using this tool to skip around the game (for example going to the madness grace before talking to melina or killing margit) will cause you to get banned!  

Disable EAC to use this tool. You will need to use something like [Luke Yui's Offline Launcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/98).

## Requirements 
* [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime x64](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/f13d7b5c-608f-432b-b7ec-8fe84f4030a1/5e06998f9ce23c620b9d6bac2dae6c1d/windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.4-win-x64.exe)  
* [.Net Framework 4.6.1]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130)
* [Visual C++ Redistributable x64 Packages for Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784)

## How To Use 
* Launch Elden Ring and get on one of your characters
* Launch Elden Ring Debug Tool.  
* Go to "Settings" and select "Spawn Untradeable"  
* Go to "Inventory" tab. You can select a category and search for the item that way, or you can check "Search All" by the search bar and search for the item that way.  
* Select an item in the listbox and hit create on the item you want to spawn. The "Ash" combobox will only be avaiable on weapons that can equip ashes.  
* If the tool doesn't connect, you may have to run it as administrator before it can see the Elden Ring process.  
* **SEAMLESS COOP ITEM CATEGORY**: Inside the Elden Ring Debug Tool folder is a Resources folder. In `Resources/ItemCategories.txt` and remove the two slashes from start of `//0x40000000 false Items/Goods/SeamlessCoop.txt Seamless Coop` (line 10). This will load the Seamless Coop items the next time the debug tool is started.  
* After re-launching the program,iIn the "Inventory" tab, there will now be a category called "Seamless Coop". This will give you a selection of the four items added by the Seamless Coop mod. Click the item you wish to create and hit the "Create" button.

## Mod Resource Folders.
These are resource folders that expand the tool to work with overhauls, like Convergence.

## Known Issues  
* Hotkeys don't save between sessions at this moment. They will Soonâ„¢  

## Installing  
* Extract contents of zip archive to it's own folder. You may have to run as admin if Elden Ring Debug Tool crashes  

## Building
To publish final output, run this command in the `Elden-Ring-Debug-Tool\` directory
```
dotnet publish '.\src\Elden-Ring-Debug-Tool-WPF\Elden-Ring-Debug-Tool-WPF.csproj' -c Release /p:PublishProfile=FolderProfile
```

## Advanced Usage
* For a param to load there has to be both a def in `Resources/Params/Defs` and a definition in on of the files in `Resources/Params/Pointers`  
* The format for pointer is `Offset:Name`. You can organize these files however you want. They will all be opened, read, split and added to the Param list, if there is a corresponding def. If the param has a shared def, you can optionally format like so `Offset:Name:ParamDefName` and the tool will look for the correct paramdef.  
* Can add names to a file with the same name as the param in `Resources/Params/Names` to add row names. Default name will just be the Row ID.  
* After saving params, you can decrypt your regulation.bin by dragging and dropping it over the debug tools exe. Rename the param to have the correct capitalization, unpack the regulation.bin with Yabber and replace the one with the saved param and then re-pack the regulation.bin with [Yabber](https://github.com/JKAnderson/Yabber/releases). You can re-encrypt the regulation file, as well, but it is unnecessary.
